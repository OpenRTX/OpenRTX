 * equivalent to an array of SCREEN_HEIGHT*SCREEN_WIDTH elements.
 * With respect to it, screen is indexed in this way:
 *
 *   (0,0)
 *     +-------> x
 *     |
 *     |    o (X,Y)
 *     |
 *     v
 *     y
 *
 * then to set the value of the pixel having coordinates (X,Y), framebuffer has
 * to be indexed in this way: buf[X + Y*SCREEN_WIDTH].
