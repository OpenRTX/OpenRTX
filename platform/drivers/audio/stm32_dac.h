 * Driver for STM32F4xx DAC peripheral used as audio output stream device.

 *
 * This driver has two instances:
 *
 * - instance 0: DAC_CH1, DMA1_Stream5, TIM6,
 * - instance 1: DAC_CH2, DMA1_Stream6, TIM7
 *
 * The possible configuration for each channel is the idle level for the DAC
 * output, ranging from 0 to 4096. Idle level is passed by value directly in the
 * config field.
