 * Tone generator for MDx family, used primarily for CTCSS tones and user

 * WARNING: this driver implements a priority mechanism between "beeps", FSK
 * modulation and audio playback. A request for FSK modulation or audio playback
 * always interrupts the generation of a "beep" tone and generation of "beep"
 * tones is disabled when FSK modulation or audio playback is active.
 *
 * This driver uses the following peripherals of the STM32F405 MCU:
 * - TIM3 as high-frequency PWM timebase.
 * - TIM14 as timebase for CTCSS and "beeps" through a sine table.
 * - TIM7 and DMA1_Stream2 for AFSK, 4FSK and playback of audio streams.
