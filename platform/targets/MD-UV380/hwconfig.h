 * To enable pwm for display backlight dimming uncomment this directive.
 *
 * WARNING: backlight pwm is disabled by default because it generates a
 * continuous tone in the speaker and headphones.
 *
 * This issue cannot be solved in any way because it derives from how the
 * MD-UV380 mcu pins are used: to have a noiseless backlight pwm, the control
 * pin has to be connected to a mcu pin having between its alternate functions
 * an output compare channel of one of the timers. With this configuration, the
 * pwm signal can completely generated in hardware and its frequency can be well
 * above 22kHz, which is the upper limit for human ears.
 *
 * In the MD-UV380 radio, display backlight is connected to PD8, which is not
 * connected to any of the available output compare channels. Thus, the pwm
 * signal generation is managed inside the TIM11 ISR by toggling the backlight
 * pin and its frequency has to be low (~250Hz) to not put too much overehad on
 * the processor due to timer ISR triggering at an high rate.
