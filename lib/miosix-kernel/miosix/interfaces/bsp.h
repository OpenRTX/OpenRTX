 * process (before the kernel is started, and when interrupts are disabled)
 *
 * bspInit2(), to perform the remaining part of the initialization, once the
 * kernel is started
 *
 * shutdown(), for system shutdown. This function is called in case main()
 * returns, and is available to be called by user code.

 * reboot(), a function that can be called to reboot the system under normal
 * (non error) conditions. It should sync and unmount the filesystem, and
 * perform a reboot. This function is available for user code.
 *
 * Other than this, the board support package might contain other functions,
