# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to OpenRTX! Due to the complexity of this project, strongly consider opening an issue to discuss your changes first, that way we can ensure proper coordination with other ongoing changes and the project's roadmap. Help is always welcome, and there's plenty of room!

## Where to start

- Improving the documentation (both in this repository and in the [adjacent website repository](https://github.com/OpenRTX/openrtx.github.io))
- Triaging issues, especially if you have the means to reproduce them and add more details to them
- Adding test coverage

In general, create a fork, get your development environment setup (we recommend VS Code with the included devcontainer), make your first build, and start exploring!

## Dev environment setup

The fastest way to get a development environment is to leverage VS Code and the included devcontainer. From there, use the Meson extension to compile your code for various targets. Some developers may prefer setting up an environment directly on their host, such as for ease of flashing to devices. Refer to [the developers guide](https://openrtx.org/#/developers_guide?id=developers39-guide) for details on how to configure Linux, Mac, and Windows development environments.

## Style Conventions

Contributions to this project should follow the conventions set in the linux kernel. This project is still adopting this standard (see https://github.com/OpenRTX/OpenRTX/issues/346), and so you'll find existing code may not be compliant. Use the `scripts/clang_format.sh` script to ensure your contributions follow the intended style conventions, and be sure to add your fully formatted files to the script while the adoption is still in progress.

## Code Organization

The principle of OpenRTX is "write it once for all devices", and the code is organized in such a way to support that. And even within UIs and platforms, there are often specific pieces that can be segmented (i.e. UIs for small screens, drivers for baseband ICs). Please observe the strict separations that the project has put in place.

The main directories for the project are described below:

```text
openrtx           # The core program, including its UI, common utilities, and features
├── include       # Public header files used throughout the project; details are only given where there are special cases
| ├── calibration # Headers for calibration data used in platform code
| ├── core        # Headers for core
| ├── fonts       # Definitions for symbol and font tables
| ├── interfaces  # Headers for interfaces
| ├── peripherals # Headers for peripherals
| ├── protocols   # Headers for protocols
| ├── rtx         # Headers for rtx
| └── ui          # Headers, plus string definitions used for localization and voice prompts
└── src           # Primary source code itself
  ├── core        # Features used across the entire app, such as state, graphics, voice prompts, etc
  ├── protocols   # Protocol implementations that are hardware agnostic; focusing on things like frame structures, encoding, and signal processing
  ├── rtx         # Operational adapters that integrate a protocol, such as handling audio routing, PTT, squelch, etc
  └── ui          # The user interfaces, which are divided into a default and a module17 implementation
platform          # Hardware specific implementations, including things like drivers for specific components, details of specific hardware targets, and low-level implementations of hardware specific needs
├── drivers       # Drivers for specific hardware platforms, organized by the type of device
├── mcu           # Micro-controller specific handlings such as drivers and abstractions
└── targets       # Platform information for specific models of radios, containing things like pin mappings and definitions for other hardware components
tests/            # Tests
├── platform      # Platform tests meant to be built and run on real harwdare, facilitating manual verification of specific functionality
└── unit          # Unit tests
meta              # Meta scripts for use with the emulator to automate running a series of tasks; may be helpful for debugging or manual testing
scripts           # Build and utility scripts
subprojects       # Git submodules of other projects that are needed to either build, develop, or test OpenRTX
```

More details about the individual components can be found on the [developer pages](https://openrtx.org/#/software).

## Testing

Changes made to this project need to be verified either manually, using automation, or preferrably a combination of both. PRs should include documentation of the testing that took place so that reviewers understand how you've managed the quality of your changes. Automated tests are run using CI, as are builds confirming each target compiles properly.

Automated tests can be run locally using meson. For example: `meson setup build && meson test -C build "M17 Golay Unit Test"`.

## Making Changes

OpenRTX uses Git for source code management. Each commit should represent a distinct change, and as such often PRs will contain multiple commits. It isn't OK, though, for a commit to contain broken or incomplete changes. Keep your branch's revision history tidy using strategies like squashing.

Also, changes that take days of effort or thousands of lines of code should be considered a yellow flag. Consider how the change could be split up into smaller, incremental changes. That way, maintainers can provide feedback more quickly and contributors have less risk of rework.

## Pull Request Process

Once you've completed a contribution, please submit it as a pull request. Ensure that you own the intellectual property that you are contributing (or have an appropriate license).

1. Make sure your branch is up-to-date, preferring to rebase your changes rather than introduce unnecessary merge commits
2. Ensure that the PR template is completed, and don't skip sections; this helps reviewers and the community understand what changes are and how they work
3. Maintainers will review new PRs as quickly as possible, but there is no time estimate or guarantee

## Release Process

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) to determine versioning. Releases are made from the default branch. Releases have release notes that are verified by the maintainers and builds that are published as assets on GitHub.

## Get in touch

Visit the [Get In Touch](https://openrtx.org/#/get_in_touch) page for the best ways to reach out. As always, leverage GitHub issues for reporting bugs and feature requests.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

### Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

1. Respecting the **purpose of our community**, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
2. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
3. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
4. **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions.
5. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
6. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
7. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our community**.

### Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

1. **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
2. **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
3. **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
4. **Sexualization.** Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
5. **Violating confidentiality**. Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
6. **Endangerment.** Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
7. Behaving in other ways that **threaten the well-being** of our community.

#### Other Restrictions

1. **Misleading identity.** Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
2. **Failing to credit sources.** Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
3. **Promotional materials**. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.
4. **Irresponsible communication.** Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.

### Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, contact a maintainer.

Maintainers take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports of code of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. Maintainers will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality. In order to honor these values, enforcement actions are carried out in private with the involved parties, but communicating to the whole community may be part of a mutually agreed upon resolution.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
