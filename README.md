# OpenRTX
## Modular Open Source Radio Firmware

OpenRTX is a free and open source firmware for digital ham radios, top-down designed
with modularity, flexibility and performance in mind.

Currently OpenRTX is being actively developed for the following radios:

- TYT MD-380/390 **UHF versions only**
- TYT MD-UV380/390
- TYT MD-9600
- Radioddity GD77

This firmware is *highly experimental* and is not in a usable state right now,
however contributions and testing are welcome and accepted.

For information on currently supported radios and features, see the [Supported Platforms](https://openrtx.org/#/platforms) page on our website.

For hardware and software documentation visit [openrtx.org](https://openrtx.org/)

**WARNING: DO NOT flash the OpenRTX firmware on an MD-380V(G) or MD-390V(G)! The codebase has not been fully tested on these devices.**

## Flash on MD-3x0 and MD-UV3x0

On TYT MD-3x0 and MD-UV3x0 you can flash our firmware using tarxvf's web based flashing tool.

- Download the latest OpenRTX release for your radio from [the releases page](https://github.com/OpenRTX/OpenRTX/releases).
- Connect your radio to the PC, put it in DFU mode (turn off, turn on pressing PTT and the button just above).
- On linux, macOS and Android, open Chrome/Chromium and navigate to [dmr.tools](https://dmr.tools),
- Click on "Upgrade", then "Connect Radio(s)", under "Select firmware file" choose "Upload from my computer",
- Click on "Choose File", select the latest OpenRTX release you downloaded before, and click on "Upgrade Radio".
- Reboot your radio

## Compile and flash

For instructions on how to compile and flash OpenRTX to your radio,
or just run OpenRTX on Linux see the [Compilation instructions](https://openrtx.org/#/compiling) page on our website.

All this was made possible by the huge reverse engineering effort of Travis Goodspeed and all the contributors of [md380tools](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools).

A huge thank goes to Roger Clark, and his [OpenGD77](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77) which not only inspired this project, but as a precursor, provided a working code example for the GD77 radio family.

Finally, a warm thank you goes to SP5WWP and the [M17](https://m17project.org) community for bringing their libre protocol into our obscure undocumented hardware.
