# OpenRTX
## Modular Open Source Radio Firmware

OpenRTX is a free and open source firmware for digital amateur radio devices, top-down designed
with modularity, flexibility and performance in mind.

Currently OpenRTX is being actively developed for the following radios:

- TYT MD-380/390
- TYT MD-UV380/390
- TYT MD-9600
- Radioddity GD77 and Baofeng DM-1801

This firmware is *highly experimental* and currently under development, this means
that it may not have all the expected functionalities. Anyway, contributions and testing will be warmly welcomed and accepted!

For information on the radios that are currently supported and their features, see the [Supported Platforms](https://openrtx.org/#/platforms) page on our website.

For hardware and software documentation visit [openrtx.org](https://openrtx.org/)

## Obtaining the firmware

**Warning: Read the disclaimer section first!**

Pre-built binary images of the OpenRTX firmware for each one of the supported devices are available on [the releases page](https://github.com/OpenRTX/OpenRTX/releases): to flash them to your radio, you can use the OEM firmware upgrade tool or — alternatively and for TYT MD-3x0 and MD-UV3x0 radios only — you can also use the [radio_tool](https://github.com/v0l/radio_tool) program or tarxvf's web based flashing tool [dmr.tools](https://dmr.tools).

Between releases, pre-built binary images containing the latest firmware updates are available through nightly builds from the master branch.
The nightly builds are available here:
- on [Phil DF5PMF's page](https://openrtx.schinken-radio.de/nightly/)
- on the [OpenRTX nightly builds page](https://files.openrtx.org/nightly/)

Finally, the instructions on how to compile the OpenRTX firmware for hardware as well as emulation on Linux, are available on the [compilation instructions](https://openrtx.org/#/compiling) page on our website.

Have a look at the the [dedicated page](https://openrtx.org/#/user_guide) for detailed instructions on flashing the firmware to your radio, look at the OpenRTX website or reach out to us on our channels!

## M17 support

From the release version 0.3.3 onwards the OpenRTX firmware provides experimental support for the M17 digital voice mode.

The following radios are currently supported for use with this digital mode:
- MD-380, MD-390 and RT3 **UHF version** are supported for both modulation and demodulation.
- MD-380, MD-390 and RT3 **VHF version** are supported for demodulation **only**, modulation is a work in progress.
- MD-UV380 and MD-UV390 are supported for both modulation and demodulation.
- GD77 and DM-1801 currently **are not supported** for the new digital voice mode.

To make the digital mode work, some modding is required: Refer to the [dedicated page](https://openrtx.org/#/M17/m17?id=hardware-modifications) on our website for the details on that.

Our wholehearted thanks go to the following contributors from the community:

- Joseph Stephen VK7JS, who implemented voice prompts

All this is possible by the huge reverse engineering effort of Travis Goodspeed and all the contributors of the [md380tools](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools).

A huge thanks goes to Roger Clark, and his [OpenGD77](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77) (repo no longer available) which not only inspired this project, but as a precursor, provided a working code example for the GD77 radio family.

A warm thank you goes to SP5WWP and the [M17](https://m17project.org) community for bringing their libre protocol into our obscure undocumented hardware.

Also, a thank you for donating hardware to this project goes to:
* M17 Project
* laurivosandi

And thanks to everyone who donated via [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/OpenRTX/donate).
