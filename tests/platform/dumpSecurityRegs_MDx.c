/*
 *
 * Use instructions:
 * setup like normal, e.g. meson setup --cross-file cross_arm.txt build_arm
 * configure this test: meson configure -Dtest=dumpSecurityRegs_MDx build_arm/
 * make sure START_TSK_STKSIZE in openrtx/src/bootstrap.c is increased (2048/sizeof(CPU_STK) is a good number) or test will not run
 * flash like normal, e.g. meson compile -C build_arm openrtx_md380_flash
 *
 * Then reboot the radio into this app once it's flashed.
 * It will print out the registers after you press a button.
 *
 * Example: minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
 * (ctrl-a o to bring up the menu, serial port setup to choose 115200 8N1)
 * (ctrl-a l to bring up minicom logging, enter to set the log filename)
 * press enter key or whatever you like, view output
 * (ctrl-a q  to close minicom)
 * the logged output is in that .cap file you named with ctrl-L
 *
 * Name it with the model number (MD380, MD380V, MD380G, MD380VG) (or MD390 variants)
 * and then the serial number, like MD380_SN12345678.cap
 * put it in this repo under data/tests/dumpSecurityRegs_MDx
